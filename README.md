## How to Run the Application

To run the application you must first install the node modules in both the React-Native folder and the Server-Heroku folder.

You will need to setup environment variables and API keys if you'd like to start your own server, if not you can set the following as an environment variable NODE_ENV=production

To start the front end application you must use command:

```bash
expo start
```

To start the backend you must use command:

```bash
npm run start:server
```

or you can simply visit the [Expo GO page](https://expo.dev/@violetleon93/hookd)
